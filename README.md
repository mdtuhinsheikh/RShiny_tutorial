# RShiny Tutorial
I gave a guest lecture on "RShiny Tutorial" in the "Categorical Data Analysis" course at UConn in Spring 2020. This repository contains the lecture materials in the form of PDF and all the RShiny app examples which were discussed in the lecture. I would like to thank Professor Ming-Hui Chen for giving me the opportunity to give a guest lecture.

The RShiny apps can be found at the 'Examples' folder.
